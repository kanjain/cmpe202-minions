## Week-1 (9/17-9/23)
### BabylonJS

* BabylonJS is a free 3D game engine. It can be run in browser. It supports a lot of advanced features like animation, physic, lights... beside the basic features.  
* I personally think the framework is really amazing and well made. It has detail tutorial both in video and documentation. You can play with the framework easily just need to go to their [playground](https://playground.babylonjs.com/). **The downside is that the framework doesn't support 2D. Given the length of the project, we should disregard this framework**.  
* I also tried to run some of the 3D example game in Macbook Air, and they seem laggy so we should not do 3D at all for our sake since we all use Macbook Air

**Pros:**  
* Great customization  
* Detail tutorial and example  
* Friendly for starter  

**Cons:**  
* It doesn't has support for 2D
