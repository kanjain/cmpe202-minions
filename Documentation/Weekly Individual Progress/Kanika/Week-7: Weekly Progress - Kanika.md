# Week-7 (11/05-11/11) Weekly Progress : Kanika

* Score resetting bug. In this, the old score was not resetting on the new game. It continued from where it left in the previous game. So fixed that.

* Fixed the merge conflict issues multiple times. 

* Added the **loading bar** before the main menu screen. Added animation to loading bar for realistic user experience.

* Also created the landing screen for the game and did animate the loading bar.

* Added another feature of **animating the score** on every minion click to make the game more realistic and for good user experience.
 
* Altered/refractored the code following SOLID single responsibilty principle.
