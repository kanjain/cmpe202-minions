# Week-4 (10/8-10/14) Weekly Progress : Kanika

**Goal:**

To build a **Use case diagram** for the game to specify actors and stakeholders.

**Use Case Diagram:**

Use case diagrams are usually referred to as behavior diagrams used to describe a set of actions (use cases) that some 
system or systems (subject) should or can perform in collaboration with one or more external users of the system (actors). 
Each use case should provide some observable and valuable result to the actors or other stakeholders of the system.

**Use Case diagram details/description:**

The use case diagram that we have built for our game has 2 actors-Player and Browser Storage.The system is our game-Jumping 
minions game. In the diagram, player selects the theme/setting he wants to go with like different background themes and 
difficulty levels. Player can go to How-to screen to make himself familiar with the game controls. He clicks on Play Game and
start playing the game. When the user starts playing the game, the system triggers an animation loop (jumping minions appear 
on the screen). Based on the rules of the game and how well the player is playing the game, the internal system/Subsystem will 
decrement the health bar and increment the score. The score will update the highScore whenever the player makes a new highscore.
Then if the player exits the game. Before exiting,system makes sure that the Highscore is updated and stored in the hard disk.
