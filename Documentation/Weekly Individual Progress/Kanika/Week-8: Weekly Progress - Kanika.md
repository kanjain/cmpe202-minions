This week I have worked on the following tasks:

* Created a How-To-Screen for the game which has all the game instructions for how to play it. Provided animations to the screen for a good look and feel. Added an animation to falling minion on the screen.

* Improved animation on the score change on clicking a minion during play.

* Created a Pause overlay screen for the game.Added a "Paused" text on overlay . Also added the functioanlity to pause or resume only on pause button click for better real time experience to the player.

* Also created a Game-Over screen that displays the current score of the player. Also added a "Try Again" and "Back to Main menu" buttons on the screen.

* Added an exit functionality on the game screen to provide user an option to quit the game anytime.

* Also added the one of the feature (score change) I worked upon in BDD(Behavioral Driven Development) document.
