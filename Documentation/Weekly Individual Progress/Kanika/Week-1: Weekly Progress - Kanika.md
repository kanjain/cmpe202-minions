## Week-1 (9/17-9/23)

### Research on Phaser.io- 2D GameEngine:

Before starting with game development, I think it’s better to research more on to which game engine we should use to build the game. Because a “good” game engine can make your work a lot easier.

A good game engine takes care of all the following:

•	Rendering on a stable frame rate •	Input handling •	User interface •	Sounds/music • Resource management (images, sound, data files) •	Saving/loading your game •	Physics (2d or 3d)

While browsing the internet for game engine options, I found Phaser.io. I think it could be a good choice for my project. The current version for Phaser framework running is Phaser 2.8.7.

What is Phaser.io? Phaser is an open source HTML5 2D game framework by Photon Storm. It creates native apps on desktop and mobile browsers.

Key Features:

•	Uses JavaScript and HTML5. Can also use TypeScript! •	Built-in Physics Engine but also easy to replace. •	Fast rendering using WebGL and Canvas while supporting Web Audio (Node based audio support). •	Input support-Keyboard, mouse, multi-touch •	Supports a plugin for developers to create additional tasks. •	Supports cross- platform browser compatibility.

Pros:

•	Support for Arcade Physics, Ninja Physics and p2.js •	Tutorials wo were easy to follow and descriptive. •	Great community resources •	Good tutorials, courses and books •	Very fast to develop with •	Super-simple loading of assets •	Easy to learn, not complicated because it requires very basic JavaScript knowledge. •	Built-in Arcade Particle system •	Animating is easy •	Excellent tools for sprites •	Level designing is easy called Tilemaps •	Easy configuration of complex physics libraries. Like Box3d •	Lot of code examples available online.

Cons:

•	 Poor performance: As long as your map is not larger than 600*400px, everything is fine.
