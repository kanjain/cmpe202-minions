# Week-2: Working on Wireframes

Since we decided on the game idea, this week I started working on the UI Wireframes. This is to get an idea as to how our app should look, the look and feel it should present and a guideline to start development

Since am not very comfortable with XD tools like Adobe Photoshop, I decide to make them using plain html and CSS.

This is how we designed our app. This will be refined further during the course of our project
## 1. Home Page

This is the page our Game opens to. Since game app involves saving minions, we wanted a very bright, colorful and peppy opening. We haven't yet named our game, so I used the name 'Catch my minions' as a place holder since it is relevant

## 2. About the Game

This the page that should have text describing the game (which I didn't add yet). 
 
## 3. Game
![](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/cmpe202-minions/blob/master/Wireframes/game.png)

This is the actual game.Evil grew decided to punish his minion my tossing them high in a forest infested with dangerous creatures. You can click on a minion and save them. As you can see in the wireframe the tossed minions are sad. The happy ones are the ones you clicked. Based on the number of minion you save, your score is evaluated.

These are just the basic wireframes. More will soon be added.
