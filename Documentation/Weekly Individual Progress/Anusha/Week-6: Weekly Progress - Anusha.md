Week-5: Creation of Strategy Pattern

We plan on developing multiple themes for the game.
Based on the theme selected, a different environment is created and provided to the gamer.
A night theme would have a dark environment and a forest theme would have a wild environment.

In order to apply an environment runtime, we have chosen the strategy theme.

Implementation of strategy theme:
1. create a function setStrategicTheme
2. create 2 classes for the 2 themes
3. On clicking a theme, call the setStrategicTheme function that sets the theme of the game accordingly
