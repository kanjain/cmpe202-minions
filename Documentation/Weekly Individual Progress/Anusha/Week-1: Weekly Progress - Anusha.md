# **Week-1:Research on Unity3D game engine**

Looked into unity3d engine as a possible game engine for our project. A little ambitious about going 3D. But it Looks way harder than its 2D counterparts.

Given the span of our project, majority of us have chosen to build a nice game in 2D Unity is pretty powerful and gives a lot of flexibility in terms of customization It has options for Coding in C# and Javascript. Not everyone in the team is familiar with C#, so javascript sounds like the better option. However, Unity javascript looks quite different from regular javascript

Tutorials in unity are pretty intense. Theres a lot of work involved in building a scene, creating a terrain etc. Given the time duration, unity does not seem a good option for our project. So it was decided to scrap it off the list

To summarize,
## Pros:
1. Extremely powerful, lot of scope for customization
2. Supports 3D Games
3. Web deployable


## Cons:
1. Steep learning curve for beginners in game development
2. Not many in the team are familiar with C#.
3. It's Javascript version is quite different from regular javscript
4. A lot of non-coding skills are also required to design every scene, construct terrains etc
5. Not a good idea given the time limitations
