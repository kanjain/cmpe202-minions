# Week-4 (10/8 - 10/21) Weekly Progress : Saurabh

Till now each team member was learning, researching and developing features assigned to them individually.However,
in order to give a meaningful form to the game I was tasked to develop a working game prototype which can be 
converted into a full fledged game in the upcoming weeks and also add some new features which we weren't previously present.

I created a new GamePrototype folder wherein I developed all the necessary files required to provide the following 
features:
* Loading the required objects and displaying a menu screen with clickable buttons.
* Starting the game on clicking the 'Play' button.
* Adding the feature to spawn different types of minions from random coordinates.
* Adding a new target sprite/object i.e. Truck which can be used to enable multiplayer feature or can be used as a target 
location for the saved minions. This needs to be finalized based on further team discussions.

This working prototype has given a common platform to all the members of the team to contribute and extend the features of the 
game such as killing the sprite objects on click event of the user and so on. This also will avoid any wastage of efforts in 
future for integrating or rewriting parts of code so as to work together with other parts of the game.

Also created a use case specification for changing or selecting levels in the game.
