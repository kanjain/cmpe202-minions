# Week-7 (11/5 - 11/11) Weekly Progress : Saurabh

* To make the game more realistic and improve user experience I added animation to the minions and bombs being spawned from 
random x and y coordinates which gives them the feeling of falling down. Each sprite object i.e. minions or bombs have a 
separate speed or velocity with which they rotate thus giving the random feeling instead of monotonous circular movement for all.

* Added a new background image, minion character animation and game theme music to the intro screen. This is the screen that 
displays the loading bar when the game assests are being loaded.

* Refactored the code to assign the responsibility of random sprite object creation to a completely new method.
