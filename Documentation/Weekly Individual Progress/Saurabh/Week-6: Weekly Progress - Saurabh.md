# Week-5 (10/29 - 11/4) Weekly Progress : Saurabh

* Created the new setup folder which contains all code the developed till now integrated. 
It is the folder which would be the final deliverable and will contain all the code going forward.
* Currently very large number of minions and bombs are getting spawned or generated in a very short interval of time. 
I have now reduced the frequency of the minions and bombs being spawned at random location and random interval of times.
* Added the new pause game feature so that the user can now pause the game while playing without loosing the progress 
and resume playing at the same state.
