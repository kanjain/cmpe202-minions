## **Greenfoot Game Engine**

Greenfoot is an interactive Java development environment designed primarily for educational purposes at the high school and undergraduate level. It allows easy development of two-dimensional graphical applications, such as simulations and interactive games.

### ** Pros: **
**Interactive Visual World**

•	Greenfoot teaches object orientation with Java. Create 'actors' which live in 'worlds' to build games, simulations, and other graphical programs.
•	Greenfoot is visual and interactive. Visualisation and interaction tools are built into the environment.
•	The actors are programmed in standard textual Java code, providing a combination of programming experience in a traditional text-based language with visual execution.

**Simple Programming IDE**
•	The interface is a full IDE which includes project management, auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and other tools common to most IDEs. It also allows you to publish your work both on and offline.
•	However the interface is designed to be simple and easy to use; built with beginners in mind.
•	Greenfoot is used by thousands of institutions around the world. It provides easy transition into other environments, such as BlueJ and more professional IDEs.

**Real Java Code**
•	Greenfoot programs are written in standard Java, one of the primary languages in academia and industry. Concepts learned transfer directly to programming in subsequent environments.

•	Greenfoot makes the environment easy enough to use for beginners, and Java makes it powerful enough to write impressive, flexible and sophisticated applications.

### **Cons.**

•	Not suitable for 3D games.
•	Not suitable for multi player games.
•	To make it run on Browser, you have to export it as Applet and embed this applet in HTML file. 

### **Conclusion**

Greenfoot is good for simple 2d game for advance features like 3D and Multiplayer gree
Knolwedge of basic java is enough to create simple games.
Several readymade classes and methods to support.
