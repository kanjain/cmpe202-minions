# Week-3 (10/1 - 10/7) Weekly Progress : Manish

## Goal: 
To build a **prototype design** for implementing some visual and sound effect, when a user click on some specified object or used some key strokes, he must able to visualize the result of the action that I just did.

## Tasks Performed: 
As an IDE, I downloaded and installed PHP Storm and as an webserver I preferred going with MAMP. 

Setup the phaser game engine in my local machine.

After setting up the very basic infrastructure like IDE, MAMP server and Phase Game Engine, I created the basic folder structure. Inside the project root folder, I created three main folder ‘src‘, ‘res’ and ‘lib’. Folder ‘src’ to store all JavaScript files that support game logic, folder ‘lib’ to store ‘phaser.min.js’ which is provided by the game engine, folder ‘res’ to store all resources like .png files, sound files etc. 

'index.php' fileis the starting point of the game. I have added one button as option to make the game full screen. I have used minion image which comes from the top as soon as you start the game. I have used left(<--),right(-->) as keys to control movements. 

## Steps to run :
Download the source code and put the source code 'HelloPhaser' folder in /MAMP/htdocs folder. Start the MAMP server, and open url http://localhost:8888/HelloPhaser .

The code for this you can find in :
