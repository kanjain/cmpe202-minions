Week-4: Creation of 'select difficulty level' Menu option

Game should have difficulty levels, when we navigate to the home screen, a button should display in the menu to
select levels. 

After clicking on 'select level' a second screen should open with different difficulty levels. 

As of now the 'Select Levels' button has been added and after cliking on that new screen with two difficulty levels button is
opening.

Currently both elevels are pointing to the same game.

In coming sprint we will change as per difficulty level.
