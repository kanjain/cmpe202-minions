# **Week 2**

## **Idea behind the Game**

This game is inspired by a very popular animation movie “Despicable Me”. Movie revolves around a character called “Gru”
a protagonist of the movie, born from the family with long line of villainy and formerly the world's greatest villain, 
Gru has a plan to steal the Moon.  Gru has an army of small, yellow, melodious henchmen who wear overalls and goggles and 
have one or two eyes, these characters called Minions. They mostly speak incomprehensible gibberish, which is partly derived 
from other languages. Gru requires the army of Minions to accomplish his evil dreams and mission.In the movie, there is one
more villain called "Eduardo Perez", who the owner of the Mexican restaurant 'Salsa & Salsa' in the Paradise Mall and the main
antagonist in Despicable Me 2. Gru and Eduardo Perez are rivals in the Villainy world. 

## **Game Story**

In our game, we are portraying Gru as a hero and Eduardo Perez as a villain. Eduardo Perez want to kill minions to destroy 
Gru's army and defeat him, Gru want to save the minions to fulfill his dream. 

Once the user enter in to the game, villain will throw minions from a height to kill them and game player has to click on 
falling minions to save them. If a player successfully click on minion, it will go to Gru's vehicle and if a player fails to 
do click on minions players life will reduce. Minions falling frequency will increase gradually and after a certain number of
successful click the stage will finish. We are planning to make few stages with different pattern and frequency of minions 
falling.
