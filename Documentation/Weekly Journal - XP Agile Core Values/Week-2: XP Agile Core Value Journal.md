# Week-2 (9/24 - 9/30)
Given below is the description of how the team followed XP/Agile values this week:

### 1. Communication (Owner - **Kanika**)
* To **communicate** transparently and effectively we have planned to meet twice in week. In the first meeting we planned our weekly tasks and assigned those tasks amongst each other. In the second meeting we discussed the challenges, team faced and tried to solve them and also discussed the individual's progress.

### 2. Simplicity (Owner - **Manish**)
* For **simplicity** sake  we divided the tasks up to the granular level and ensured that every is having one task in his plate
and no one is doing more than one task at a time. 

### 3. Respect (Owner - **Anusha**)
* We made sure each one of us has the liberty to chose a task of his/her choice. We **respected ** each one's opinion and took 
a cumulative decision on building a criteria for what would de ideal for our team. We collectively decided milestones in 
building the game from the scratch.

### 4. Feedback (Owner - **Trung**).  
* Taking feedback from each other about their strength and weakness so that the team have a better distribution of roles.
* Discuss about the type of game that we should make and planning on learning to how to do it in code.  

### 5. Eliminate Waste (Owner - **Saurabh**)
* We researched on different design patterns and tried to came up with suitable patterns that we can use to reduce the 
complexity while building the game.We have eliminated the redundant issues/tasks from the git so that it would be more clear 
to the team members what they need to do for this week.
