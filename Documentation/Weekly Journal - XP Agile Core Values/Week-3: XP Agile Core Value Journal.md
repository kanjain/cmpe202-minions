# Week-3 (10/1 - 10/7)
Given below is the description of how the team followed XP/Agile values this week:

### 1. Communication (Owner - **Kanika**)
* To achieve the communication goal for this week properly,we met once a week in person because the goals to achieve for the week were discussed elaboratively and clearly in the fist meeting only and the tasks were assigned to individual team member on that basis. Then to make sure the work is properly done and no one is facing any sort of problem, we have formed one common group on whatsapp(an online chat messenger) on which every individual can update his/her progress for the 3rd week and can discuss the difficulty if he/she is facing while doing the tasks which helped us to save alot of time this week.

### 2. Simplicity (Owner - **Manish**)
* 

### 3. Respect (Owner - **Anusha**)
* 

### 4. Feedback (Owner - **Trung**).  
* Discuss about team's schedule on midterm week, our team share thoughts on implementing physics, sound, input, animation. There is a confusion with physics object x, y location on the game. The team takes note on it.

### 5. Eliminate Waste (Owner - **Saurabh**)
* After initial discussion the tasks for the week were found to be very high level and couple of team members had common components in their tasks. We discussed further and fine grained the objectives of the tasks so as to eliminate dependency between each team member's task thereby avoiding any wastage of efforts with both team members working on the common parts individually.
