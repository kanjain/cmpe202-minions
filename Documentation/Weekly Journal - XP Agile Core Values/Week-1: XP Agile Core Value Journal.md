# Week-1 (9/17 - 9/23)
Given below is the description of how the team followed XP/Agile values this week:

### 1. Communication (Owner - Kanika)
* To communicate properly and effectively we decided to meet at-least twice a week so that we can make that repo with other team members and to make sure that we all are on same page. Initially everyone had different opinions about the scope of the project such 2D vs 3D game, Single Player or Multiplayer, Cross Browser or Browser Specific. We discussed amongst ourselves about the challenges that we can face during this project such as deliverable time lines, learning curve, prior knowledge and complexity in developing 3d vs 2d game. We all finally concluded to go with developing a 2d web browser game using phaser.io.

### 4. Feedback (Owner - **Trung**)
* While discussing the game engines, and idea about the game, we took feedback from each team member and come up with decision base on our technical background and the type of game that we are trying to make.  
* Since we are also business owner, we all agree to have feedback regularly on the game's features and the design of the game and commit to a early working software.

### 5. Eliminate Waste (Owner - **Saurabh**)
* We distributed the tasks amongst ourselves to come up with findings of all game engines so that we can eliminate the options and keep one which suits our development and project needs.
