# Week-1 (9/17 - 9/23)
Given below is the description of how the team followed XP/Agile values this week:
### 4. Feedback (Owner - **Trung**)
* While discussing the game engines, and idea about the game, we took feedback from each team member and come up with decision base on our technical background and the type of game that we are trying to make.  
* Since we are also business owner, we all agree to have feedback regularly on the game's features and the design of the game and commit to a early working software.

### 5. Eliminate Waste (Owner - **Saurabh**)
* We distributed the tasks amongst ourselves to come up with findings of all game engines so that we can eliminate the options and keep one which suits our development and project needs.
