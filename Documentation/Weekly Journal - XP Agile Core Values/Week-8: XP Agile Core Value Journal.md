# Week-8 (11/12 - 11/18)

Given below is the description of how the team followed XP/Agile values this week:

## 1. Communication (Owner - Kanika)
This week we were left with mostly implementing last minute features to the game to make it more user enjoyable and to give final touch ups to the game for better look and feel and doing the imporvements.Everyone was assigned his/her issues to resolve for this week. Also to to avoid conflicts while merging, we tried to make sure that no two persons are working on the same file. We did daily virtual meeting for half an hour to have the recent progress and whether anyone is facing any issue and also to resolve the bug as soon as possible instead of keeping it for next week.

## 2. Simplicity (Owner - Manish)


## 3. Respect (Owner - Anusha)
This week we had a lot of ideas for last minute enhancements in the game. All ideas were great but we had to execute them carefully and sequentially to ensure nothing breaks in the last moment and each ones code doent conflict with the other. A lot of mutual respect and understanding helped us achieve this.

## 4. Feedback (Owner - Trung)

## 5. Eliminate Waste (Owner - Saurabh)

This week we improved the code further and removed / eliminated some code which was either redundant or could have been written more efficiently. We also eliminated old smaller and poor resolution images and used new high quality images.
