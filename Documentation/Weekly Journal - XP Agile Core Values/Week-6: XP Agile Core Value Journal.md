# Week-6 (10/22 - 11/4)

Given below is the description of how the team followed XP/Agile values this week:

## 1. Communication (Owner - Kanika)
As an owner of communication, I made sure that every person has the clear vision what he/she needs to do this week. This week, we are working on the final game instead of working on prototype. So we had to be cautious while checkin our respective works to the master. So for a good communication, we all decided to let the team know on whatsapp group about every current checkin anyone made.

## 2. Simplicity (Owner - Manish)
 For simplicity, we decided to check in our changes in Github by following proper branching and merging techniques. So that no one's task should be overwritten and lost. 

## 3. Respect (Owner - Anusha)
This week there was a lot of code we checked in. Giving due respect to each other, and not braking anyone's code we made sure to regularly pull and push from git. In case of conflicts,we resolved them wuth muatual discussions.


## 4. Feedback (Owner - Trung)

## 5. Eliminate Waste (Owner - Saurabh)
This week each team member while doing there tasks tried to improve the overall quality of the code by eliminating any piece of code that was unused and unnecessary or which was not adding any particular benefit to the logic of the game or worse was hindering the smooth functioning of the game. The goal is to get cleaner and good quality code at the end of the project.
