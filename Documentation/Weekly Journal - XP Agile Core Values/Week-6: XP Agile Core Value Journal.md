# Week-6 (10/22 - 11/4)

Given below is the description of how the team followed XP/Agile values this week:

## 1. Communication (Owner - Kanika)
As an owner of communication, I made sure that every person has the clear vision what he/she needs to do this week. This week, we are working on the final game instead of working on prototype. So we had to be cautious while checkin our respective works to the master. So for a good communication, we all decided to let the team know on whatsapp group about every current checkin anyone made.

## 2. Simplicity (Owner - Manish)
 

## 3. Respect (Owner - Anusha)


## 4. Feedback (Owner - Trung)

## 5. Eliminate Waste (Owner - Saurabh)
