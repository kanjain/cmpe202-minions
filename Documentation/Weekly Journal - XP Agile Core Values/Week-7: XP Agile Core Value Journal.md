# Week-7 (11/5 - 11/11)

Given below is the description of how the team followed XP/Agile values this week:

## 1. Communication (Owner - Kanika)
This week we were left with mostly implementing last minute features to the game to make it more user enjoyable.For this, everyone was assigned his/her task to add some new feature to make the game look more realistic. As now we are working with git merge, so to avoid conflicts while merging, we tried to make sure that no two persons are working on the same file. We did daily virtual meeting for half an hour to have the recent progress on the game and to make sure that everyone is on the same page.

## 2. Simplicity (Owner - Manish)
We started devlopment with simle usability features like Simple Scoring, No Music,Simple Background etc. Now as the system is stable  we are gradually adding more spohosticated feature like Sound, Variable Scoring,Animation, Game Difficulty Level etc. 


## 3. Respect (Owner - Anusha)


## 4. Feedback (Owner - Trung)

## 5. Eliminate Waste (Owner - Saurabh)
This week we improved the code quality by eliminating redundant code by refactoring and redesigning certaing parts of the code. 
We also deleted some of the previous feature development branches which had been merged into the master.
