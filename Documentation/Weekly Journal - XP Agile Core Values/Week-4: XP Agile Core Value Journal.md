# Week-4 (10/8 - 10/14)

Given below is the description of how the team followed XP/Agile values this week:

## 1. Communication (Owner - Kanika)

To make sure communication is done properly for this week, we met on Monday to start with this week progress.Brainstormed on what would the deliverables and how to achieve them. We couldnt meet twice because it was hard to co-ordinate with team members because of the midterms.So we tried to dicsuss the ideas and goals elaboratively and clearly in the first meeting so that everyone can start with their respective works assigned. We are in continuious touch with each other on the created whatsapp group. Every team member can post his/her doubt on the group and someone will surely respond to it. Apart from the midterm, we tried to deliver the assigned work on time because we tried to communicate well the ideas in the first meeting and by tuesday everyone had their assigned tasks. 

## 2. Simplicity (Owner - Manish)

## 3. Respect (Owner - Anusha)

## 4. Feedback (Owner - Trung)

## 5. Eliminate Waste (Owner - Saurabh)
