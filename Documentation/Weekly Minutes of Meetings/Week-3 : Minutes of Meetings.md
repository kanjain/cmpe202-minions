## 2.  What is the team going to do next week?
* Come up with a better velocity/gravity formular and try to randomize it better.  
* Finalizing on the main features of the game and draw a finalize version of Use Case Diagram.  

## 3.  What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
* We are going to have hard time finishing works next week due to midterm.  
* The Phaser's documentation is not well written, it is not clear on the return object and their relative (extend in java term) parent object.  
* The Phaser's community is quite small so we have to dig everything out ourself.
