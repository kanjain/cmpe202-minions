* Initial draft of wireframe.   
* Discuss on the type of game we are going to make.  
  * The game is about saving minions from falling prey to dangerous creatures in the forest. They 've been taken there by the evil Gru. Saving them is all about catching them (clicking them ) before they land on the ground. similar to fruit ninja but on web. In our game the player score when he successfully clicks on the a flying Minions (which follow some physics). If the player miss, their life bar will go down. Minions falling frequency will increase gradually and after a certain score, the stage will finish. We are planning to make few stages with different pattern and frequency of minions falling.

* JavaScript design pattern takes different form compare to Java design pattern, so there is uncertainty on how we can apply these design pattern into the project.
* Schedule differences, we can't meet early in the week due to our schedule.
* Adapting to Kanban work flow. It is hard for us to spend 1-2 hour per day. Schedule is a big problem.
