# Week-7 (11/5 - 11/11) - Minutes of Meeting

## 1.  What did the team do the past week?
* Created a "You lost the game" page which is displayed when the user losses and displays the final score.
* Created a new intro screen showing loading bar when the game starts.
* Added animation to the minions and bombs being spawned from random coordinates which gives them the feeling of falling down.
This makes the game more realistic and improves user experience.
* Resized the objects in the game to be on the same scale.
* Set the backgrounds and themes as per the wireframes.
* Fixed the score resetting bug and the score now starts from 0 for every new game.  
* Added some more sound effects when the user interacts with the minions.
* Started developing the sequence diagram for the game.

## 2.  What is the team going to do next week?
* Make final improvements to the UI and overall look and feel of the game.
* Refactor and improve the code further for simplicity and better maintenance.
* Prepare and complete the activity diagrams.
* Prepare and complete sequence diagrams.
* Complete and verify all the deliverables for the project.
* Add some extra bonus features if time permits.

## 3.  What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
* Code merging since there were a lot of conflicts due to parallel work being done.
