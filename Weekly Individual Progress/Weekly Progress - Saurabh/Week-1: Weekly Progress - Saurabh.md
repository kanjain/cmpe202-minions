# Week-1 (9/17 - 9/23)

## Research on MelonJS game engine

* melonJS is an open source HTML5 game engine that provides support for several third-party tools which can be combined to make a game.
* One of the most talked about feature of melonJS is the Tiled map editor integration that will allow us to easily design levels and to focus on the game features itself.
* It also provides several other features like collision detection, tween, sprites, audio, game layers, etc. that can help us to manage the functionality of games.
* The tutorial to develop the basic game was quite easy and required comparatively less amount of coding.
* However as per the popular “Slant” community website the MelonJS ranks 8th in the list of best HTML5/JavaScript game engines for web based games and recommends using Phaser game engine instead of melonJS which we are already researching about. (https://www.slant.co/versus/1963/1966/~melonjs_vs_phaser)
* MelonJS is a game engine developed by JavaScript enthusiasts who wanted a simple and free library to create simple games.
* Throughout the research I found that some of the other popular game engines offer far more features and support than melonJS hence I believe that even though melonJS is a good starting point we should focus on other more highly used game engines like Phaser.

### Pros:
* Natively integrates Tiled map editor which is a free, open-source map editor that supports orthogonal, isometric and staggered maps.
* Compatible with some versions of all the existing popular browsers.
* Provides support for System and Bitmap fonts.
* It has a state manager and customizable loader and offers Mouse, Touch, Pointer, and Gamepad device support.
* Device motion, orientation, and accelerometer are also supported.

### Cons:
API is known to break frequently especially due to changes in version.
